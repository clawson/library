## Welcome

This site is my online library.

I need a place to store information and the status of my collection.  I am also willing to share:  I'm willing to gift, loan, or sell -- depending on the title and requester.

Since many of the people who may be interested in borrowing books from me are fellow computer nerds/geeks, GitHub seemed like a nice place to host this information.
